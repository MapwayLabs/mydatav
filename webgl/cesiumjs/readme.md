## Adding Imagery

Supported Imagery Formats:

- WMS
- TMS
- WMTS (with time dynamic imagery)
- ArcGIS
- Bing Maps
- Google Earth
- Mapbox
- Open Street Map

By default, Cesium uses Bing Maps for imagery.

## Adding Terrain

Supported Terrain Formats:

- Quantized-mesh, an open format developed by the Cesium team
- Heightmap
- Google Earth Enterprise

## Loading and Styling Entities

Cesium supports popular vector formats GeoJson and KML

## 3D Tiles

Using a technique conceptually similar to Cesiumâ€™s terrain and imagery streaming, 3D
Tiles make it possible to view gigantic models, including `buildings datasets`, `CAD (or BIM) models`, `point clouds`, and `photogrammetry models`, which would otherwise be
impossible to view interactively.
